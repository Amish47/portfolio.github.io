    <h3>About Myself</h3>
    <img class="a" src="5.png" style="width:auto; height:auto; margin:0px 10px; border-radius:7px;" >
    <p>I am someone who is deeply committed to continuous personal and professional growth, understanding that each step,
       both small and large, shapes who I am and who I am becoming. I approach life with a sense of curiosity, eager to explore new ideas, opportunities, and challenges that push me outside my comfort zone. This openness extends to every aspect of my life, whether it's expanding my knowledge through learning, building meaningful relationships with people from all walks of life, or taking on new projects that allow me to grow both personally and professionally. I believe in the power of perseverance, and I approach obstacles with a mindset that views them as learning opportunities rather than setbacks. In addition to pursuing my goals with passion and dedication, I also prioritize maintaining a sense of balanceâ€”recognizing the importance of rest, self-reflection, and mindfulness. By taking time to recharge, I ensure that I remain focused and energized for the challenges ahead. I am driven by a sense of purpose and always strive to make a positive impact in the lives of others, whether through collaboration, mentorship, or simply offering support when needed. Above all, I am motivated by a desire to contribute meaningfully to the world around me, embracing the belief that every action, no matter how small, can create ripples of positive change. As I continue on my journey, I am excited by the possibilities that lie ahead and remain committed to growing, learning, and evolving every day.
       i am passionate about design and develpment right now and have a curious ming for it.
       I like being creative and think that i will do very good in the feild of imagination and creaivity.</p>

        <div style="background-color:blanchedalmond "><h4>Education</h4>I completed my formal education with a strong academic foundation and a commitment to continuous learning. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science from the University of California, where I developed a deep understanding of ecosystems, sustainability practices, and climate change mitigation strategies. Throughout my time at UC, I was an active participant in research projects, collaborating with faculty and fellow students to explore innovative solutions to environmental challenges. My coursework included subjects such as ecology, environmental policy, and renewable energy technologies, which provided me with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

            In addition to my degree, I pursued several certifications in data analysis and geographic information systems (GIS) to complement my studies and enhance my technical expertise. These certifications allowed me to gain proficiency in analyzing environmental data and spatial information, tools essential for addressing modern environmental issues.
            
            During my college years, I was also involved in a number of extracurricular activities that enriched my educational experience. I volunteered with the campus sustainability committee, where I worked on projects aimed at reducing the university's carbon footprint, such as waste diversion and promoting the use of renewable energy sources on campus. My leadership roles in student organizations helped me develop strong teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills, which I continue to use in my professional life.
            
            The combination of academic learning, hands-on experience, and leadership roles has not only shaped my career aspirations but also instilled in me a passion for lifelong learning. I am continuously seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge in environmental science, and I remain dedicated to making a meaningful impact in the field.
